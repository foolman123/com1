                <strong><i>Fox News - Residents paying exorbitant electricity bills is no longer a secret, as power companies have a monopoly on them. This genius’s new invention will save you thousands of dollars in electricity bills every year.</i></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Elon Musk, the talented CEO behind solar giant Tesla, has recently become a topic of discussion.<b> What has recently sparked controversy is a genius energy-saving invention suitable for those who cannot afford expensive solar panels. </b>The power company is very angry and hopes to ban Elon’s money saving invention before the American public can fully utilize the saved funds.
            </p>

            <p>He continued, "<b>The big power companies are deceiving you.</b> Yes, that’s right. Believe it or not, they've been deceiving you with a secret every time you turn on the lights, dishwasher, mixer, vacuum cleaner, and any other suction device. That’s why your electricity bills are so expensive every month and are constantly rising, with some
                <b>residents paying up to $500 in electricity bills per month.</b>
                With this revolutionary technology, every American can reduce their electricity bills by 90%. You're welcome, America."
            </p>

                <b>Pictured: Our readers old bill vs. new bill after using Elon’s invention.</b>
            </div>
            <p>How serious is this little-known scam? A new research report states that <b>Americans pay up to $27.6 billion in extra electricity bills every year</b> as a result!
            </p>

            <p>But for Elon Musk, this is not just an invention to counter greedy power companies. <b>When a tragedy occurred at Tesla’s factory, he knew he had to take action. Dorothy Smith is a 64 year old Tesla employee who died from heatstroke due to unpaid electricity bills, and her services were shut down in a record breaking heatwave. Her little daughter came to check on her situation after several missed calls and unfortunately found Dorothy lying on the sofa with her husband, lifeless.</b>
            </p>

            <p>"The scorching heat is coming. She doesn't have electricity or air conditioning, can you imagine? She’s very proud, but shy of seeking help. <b>No one knows she’s behind and can't afford high electricity bills anymore. </b>She has always been a very active person, always around the house, and nothing can stop her."<b>Such a tragedy could happen to any American family, who would ask themselves every month, should I buy groceries to eat or pay $400 for electricity to keep the lights on? Dorothy’s story is the story of every American. We would like to commemorate her with this report.</b>

            <p>"This tragedy shocked the Tesla factory and they mourned the fallen colleagues. Many employees asked me what help they could provide. When I heard this news, I was personally shocked. <b>Dorothy is such a kind soul and an indispensable part of the team’s success. She worked very hard. She worked hard and looked forward to retiring early. The unethical power industry has driven up prices during this difficult period and completely lost control. </b>They should not be allowed to lose power during this period, and these rising prices are unsustainable for ordinary people. Just for the livelihood of American families. I will ensure that this important project is not only dedicated to Dorothy, but also to humanity itself. This project is very important to us. "- Elon Musk </b>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b><i>"After Dorothy passed away, I started reading all these reports, which showed that electricity prices in the United States had been rising for years, which was worrying because I knew people were struggling to pay bills while the CEO of the power company became wealthier. Thousands of Dorothy fell behind at some point and could no longer make payments.”</i></b>

            <h2>The Perfect Storm of Innovation...</h2>


            <p>Seeing how much electricity prices have caused damage to the wallets of ordinary Americans and witnessing the unfortunate death of his employee Dorothy Smith, Elon Musk began searching for old blueprints of the energy-saving invention he invented when he was young in South Africa. The initial drawings were based on the concepts of his idol, legendary inventor, electrical and mechanical engineer, and visionary <b>Nikola Tesla.</b>
            </p>

            <p>After several hours of searching through the old files, he found it! Elon immediately called one of Tesla’s smartest engineers and trusted friend Ed Sherwood. Combining their professional knowledge, they set out to turn Elon’s <b>dream of saving electricity into a reality.</b></p>


            <p>After working in the back room of the Tesla factory for a few weeks, they completed a project. After weeks of mourning for the death of Tesla’s factory, this is the source of happiness.</b>
            </p>

            <h2>How do power companies deceive the public? How does a power Watt Savers work?</h2>

            <p>Watt Savers is a small, compact, affordable, and <b>easy-to-use plug-in device that can prevent unnecessary electricity from entering your home’s cables and immediately reduce your consumption. </b>You just need to insert it to unleash the magic of this smart device. The connection is easy, just plug it into the socket closest to the circuit breaker box. This is all you need to do, and when inserted, the green LED indicates that it is powered on and working.
            </p>

            <p>In fact, all electrical appliances consume more electricity than they need to operate, due to the low efficiency and noise of sine waves generated by power companies in order to overcharge customers and deceive them. <b>The power company takes advantage of this situation to charge customers exorbitant fees. Due to its monopoly position, the government is unwilling to intervene and resolve this situation.</b>
            </p>

            <p>Watt Savers can reduce noise and thus reduce power consumption. So none of them were wasted. <b>It does not change the meter reading or steal electricity from other places, it only uses energy more effectively, so it requires less.</b>
            </p>

            <p>In just 24 hours, it can more effectively utilize total energy consumption, thereby saving energy. <b>Your next electricity bill should be significantly reduced as it will adapt to the energy usage in your home and prevent excess electricity from entering the cables.</b>
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                <b>"Watt Savers is the most terrifying nightmare for power companies" Elon said. </b>They have been trying to hide Watt Savers from daily consumers and prohibit its use in retail stores, only selling it online. The large energy company is threatened by the equipment and its potential for profit reduction.
            </p>

            <p>Few people realize that utility companies can overload circuits, thereby shortening the lifespan of electrical appliances. <b>Watt Savers helps household appliances by extending their lifecycle. </b>This means that Watt Savers will quickly recover costs.
            </p>

            <p>The power company is spending millions of dollars lobbying the government to remove it from store shelves. Because they knew it would seriously erode their huge profits, they made every effort not to let it fall into the hands of the homeowner. Ensuring that it enters the hands of every American has become Elon’s mission.

            <h2>Putting Watt Savers to the Test...</h2>

            <p>After Elon got his hands on the first prototype produced, he distibuted them for free to a private test group tasked with putting the Watt Savers to the test and sharing their results online.
            </p>

            <p><b>Erik Dale shared his savings with us and the results were astonishing. "I don’t usually write reviews, but I have to share some numbers with you all? In the first month, we saved $100. By the second month, $185!!!. This invention only gets smarter over time and continues to save. If that isn’t a strong testimonial, I'm not sure what is!?"</b>

            </div>
            <p>Another tester named David Sansbury wrote in a comment: <b>"I am very surprised by the amount saved using these Watt Savers devices? In fact, you only need to plug them in! When we received the first device, my wife was shocked that we saved $120 on the bill! And since then, it will only become better? We will become lifelong customers."</b>
            </p>


            <p>
                With Elon Musk’s dream coming true and his invention working perfectly, it’s time to do some real good deeds. They finally finalized the plan to establish a manufacturing factory for a new Tesla supported startup he created for Watt Savers. They launched the first 100 consumer models within 2 weeks and developed plans to expand production scale, <b>providing Watt Savers to anyone in the United States who wants or needs it by the fall of 2023.</b>

            </div>
            <p><b>Yes, Watt Savers is 100% legal for use.</b> There is no risk in using this magical power saving device. Of course, power companies are not happy with people using it and have reduced their profits. But they are powerless and can only do their best to keep energy-saving appliances away from as many households as possible.</p>
            <p>Considering the cost savings that this device can save, many people consider it a huge investment. However, this is not the case.<b> In order to expand the popularity of Watt Savers nationwide, they offer our readers EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT for a limited period of time.</b>
            </p>
            <p>However, due to recent media attention and increasing pressure from large power companies, these cost-effective tools may soon become impossible to find. And because power companies have been trying to hide Watt Savers from the public, many retail stores have banned its use. However, thanks to the internet, this term has been able to spread and continues to grow in people’s cognition and use. Due to the energy savings, the return they receive is much lower energy consumption and longer running time for household appliances.</p>


            <h2>What does Elon Musk’s invention mean for all of us? </h2>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>With the increase in winter heating costs and the rising cost of living, <b>Watt Savers is the cheapest and best way to save electricity bills.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Starting from this autumn, Elon has fulfilled his promise to make Watt Savers available to anyone who wants to permanently <b>reduce their electricity bills. </b>His commitment also brought surprising affordability, as he learned everything from Tesla’s simplified manufacturing process.
            </p>
            <p>He has now launched a
                <strong><a href="https://8q878.bemobtrk.com/click"
                           target="_blank">website where you can purchase Watt Savers throughout North America</a></strong>,
                This month, they are conducting a 50% special promotion just to pay for their production costs. He hopes to ensure that <b>anyone who wants to fight against the power company and reduce electricity bills by up to 90% can do so.</b> But you should take immediate action because <b style="text-decoration: underline;">after Black Friday they announce that they may run out of electricity at any time before Christmas</b>, or before the power company successfully bans electricity.
            </p>

            <p>We have received some of the first batch of Watt Savers products, and considering their effectiveness, they are an amazing bargain that everyone should snap up before selling out.</p>

            <p>Absolutely right.
            </p>

            <p>Firstly, anything that Elon comes into contact with is a technological miracle.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, it is expected that this winter will be colder than usual, which means electricity bills will rise, and the power company also plans to set a record high for price increases.

            <p>Now is the best time to purchase Watt Savers before the exclusive discount ends. It’s already selling like crazy, and you'll soon understand why thousands of Americans have already ordered them! The icing on the cake is the price. If it is still being promoted at a price below $75 - of course, pick some before they disappear forever.</p>
            <p>You may think that considering the functionality of this technology, it may cost a lot of money. Wrong!
